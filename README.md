# `launchtab` - crontab files for launchctl
### `launchtab` is a command-line tool which helps with bridging the gap between crontab and launchctl

## Usage
`launchtab` is easy to use and has no configuration.

Convert a crontab file into PLISTs in ~/Library/LaunchAgents with one command:
```sh
$ ltab services.ltab
```

## More Information
The `example` directory in this repository contains example crontab files.
These files can be converted into PLISTS in ~/Library/LaunchAgents using `launchtab`!
